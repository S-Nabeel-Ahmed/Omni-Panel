    <ol>
      <li>
        Distributed ledger technologies are still at an early stage of maturation, having been many of these networks
        created recently, so they may not be sufficiently tested and there may be significant failures in their
        operation and security. Likewise, the registration of transactions in networks based on distributed ledger
        technologies works through consensus protocols that may be susceptible to attacks that attempt to modify said
        registry and, if these attacks are successful, there would be no alternative record that supports these
