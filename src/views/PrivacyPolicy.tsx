      collected by these log files include internet protocol addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP),
      date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any
      information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is to analyse trends, administer the
