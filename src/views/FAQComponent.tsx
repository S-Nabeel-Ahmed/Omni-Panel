        <Accordion.Header>Can I unlock my tokens before the staking period ends?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          No. Once your tokens have been locked in the staking program, you will be unable to unstake them until the end
          of the locking period specified.

          Is it possible to add tokens to an already staked amount in order to reach a higher tier?
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          No. The amount of tokens staked in a single interaction will determine your staking tier. If you stake 600,000
          tokens you will have gold tier and if you then stake another 750,000 tokens you will have gold tier on the 2nd
          batch as well, even though your total staked amount would push you into the diamond tier.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your highest amount staked in a single transaction determines your tier level for the entire wallet. To reach
          Gold tier, you must stake 600,000 tokens in one transaction. To reach Diamond tier, you must stake 1,000,000
          tokens in one transaction.

          Can I stake above the minimum amount of tokens required for a tier while still obtaining the same APY on the
          full amount of tokens?
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          Yes this is possible at all tiers. For example, if you stake 1,200,000 tokens you will receive the APY of
          diamond tier on all 1,200,000 tokens and not just the 1,000,000 tokens required to hit the diamond tier.

          What happens if I can not access my wallet anymore and would like to unstake?
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          Due to the decentralized nature of our platform, this will not be possible and we do not have access to your
          tokens or the ability to unstake them on your behalf. You are entirely responsible for your own wallet and we
          regrettably will be unable to help in any instances of lost wallets.

        <Accordion.Header>What is the maximum amount of ORT tokens I can stake per instance?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          There is no limit to the amount you can stake in a single instance. The APY return is calculated on your
          staking tier .

          When will we receive our OMNI debit card as part of the luxury staking program?
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          The debit cards are a future feature of the staking program and more details will be announced following the
          first property sale.

        <Accordion.Header>How are commission rewards distributed and how often?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          The paid commission rewards are distributed once per month in the form of an airdrop directly to your wallet.

        <Accordion.Header>How do cashbacks work?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          The cashback percentage is based on the commission that you pay when purchasing a F-NFT. These cashbacks will
          be distributed once per month via airdrop.

        <Accordion.Header>How does the free night stay work as part of the luxury staking program?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          You can get free nights upon a booking as described in the staking tiers table. For example, a gold tier
          member staking for 12 months will be eligible for a free night as part of a 7 day booking. Alternatively, you
          can request the value of your free nights in ORT tokens as an alternative reward.

          What happens when I have two seperate staking instances that would give me more benefits when combined? Will
          my staking amounts be aggregated and summed up?
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          With multiple staking instances, you will get the benefits of the highest tier you stake for. The APY however
          is calculated per staking instance.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you stake 600,000 in the first week, that batch will receive the APY of gold tier for the entire staking
          period. If you later stake an additional batch of 1,000,000 tokens, the 1,000,000 tokens will be eligible for
          the APY of the diamond tier. The original 600,000 tokens will continue to receive the APY of the gold tier
          that they were originally staked at.
          <br />
          <br />
          To receive the APY returns of a certain tier, you must stake the minimum amount required by that tier in a
          single transaction, you cannot “add on” to your previous staked amounts.
